### ADVANCED RED TEAM TRAINING

# CRTA Notes  
## Real-World Active Directory Attacks, Explained Step-by-Step

If you’re preparing for **CRTA**, **red team roles**, or serious **Active Directory exploitation**, these notes are built to save you **months of confusion and trial-and-error**.

This is **not theory**.  
This is exactly how AD attacks work in real environments.

## What Makes These CRTA Notes Different?

Most AD resources:
- Explain tools, not **attack logic**

These notes are different.

**You get a complete attacker mindset**, from initial foothold to domain dominance.
