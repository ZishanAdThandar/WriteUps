### WIRELESS SECURITY · PRACTICAL OFFENSIVE TRAINING

# OSWP Notes  
## A Clear, No-BS Guide to Wireless Pentesting That Actually Works

OSWP is not about memorizing Wi-Fi theory.  
It’s about **executing attacks cleanly, calmly, and correctly under pressure**.

These notes exist so you don’t waste time:
- Googling half-working commands
- Debugging broken adapters
- Guessing why an attack failed

This is **practical wireless exploitation**, explained simply.

## Why Most People Struggle With OSWP

Common problems:
- Tools work sometimes, fail other times
- Attacks explained without context
- Labs feel easy, exam feels stressful
- No clear decision flow when things break

OSWP punishes **uncertainty** — not lack of tools.

These notes fix that.
