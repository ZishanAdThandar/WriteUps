## Task 1

- Got a zip file need to get password to unzip it.
- After decoding hash on the main page, ROT13, ROT47, hex and base64 decoding lead to decoded text "It's inside the text, in front of your eyes!".
- So, as in decoded text if we look inside text (source code) of the page, we can find unusual encoding around "Hmm".
- There is zero width text, decoded with https://330k.github.io/misc_tools/unicode_steganography.html and got the password, "Password is *******".
- Used the password and unzipped the zip file to get the flag.
