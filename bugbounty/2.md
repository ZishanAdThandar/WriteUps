My overall experience with edmodo is good. They give quick response + cool swag + lots of input fields to test.
This time it was not planned. I was trying on many programs. 
Suddenly I opened edmodo and this time it redirected to new.edmodo.com. 
I posted my xss polyglot (as described on <a href="./1.html">my first write up</a>) on created school. 
This time I posted payloads on poll. 
Then I clicked on my dp to open my profile and it redirected me to <a href="www.edmodo.com">www.edmodo.com/*</a>. 
On this domain, there was some notification. I clicked notification and boom. It’s there.
