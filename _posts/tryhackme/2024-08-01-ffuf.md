## Tools

- [HackiFy](https://github.com/ZishanAdThandar/HackiFy)
- [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf)
- [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists)

## Introduction

- Read this section, install ffuf and Seclists, then click on "Complete" buttons.
- I used automated tool and wordlist installer `HackiFy` to install those tools. Repo: https://github.com/ZishanAdThandar/HackiFy
## Basics

- Read this section properly, connect to the network with openvpn or start `AttackBox`.
- Click on `Start the Machine`.
- Used the given command `ffuf -u http://MACHINE_IP/NORAJ -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt:NORAJ`, just replaced `seclists` location with `/opt/wordlist/SecLists/` as HackiFy install it inside `/opt/wordlist` directory.
- Question `What is the first file you found with a 200 status code?` Answer `favicon.ico`
## Finding pages and directories

- If we run first command `ffuf -u http://MACHINE_IP/FUZZ -w /opt/wordlist/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-files-lowercase.txt` we can get some output.
- Question `What text file did you find?` Answer `robots.txt`
- If we run second command given `ffuf -u http://MACHINE_IP/indexFUZZ -w /opt/wordlist/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/web-extensions.txt` , we can get output.
- Question `What two file extensions were found for the index page?` Answer `php,phps`
- Again we need to run third given command `ffuf -u http://MACHINE_IP/FUZZ -w /opt/wordlist/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-words-lowercase.txt -e .php,.txt` and observe the output.
- Question `What page has a size of 4840?` Answer `about.php`
- If we run last given command, `ffuf -u http://MACHINE_IP/FUZZ -w /opt/wordlist/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories-lowercase.txt`. We will get some directories.
- Question `How many directories are there?` Answer `4`
## Using filters

- Question `After applying the fc filter, how many results were returned?` Answer `11`. Got by observing output of command `ffuf -u http://MACHINE_IP/FUZZ -w /opt/wordlist/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-files-lowercase.txt -fc 403`.
- Question `After applying the mc filter, how many results were returned?` Answer `6` . Got by observing output of command `ffuf -u http://MACHINE_IP/FUZZ -w /opt/wordlist/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-files-lowercase.txt -mc 200`
- Question `Which valuable file would have been hidden if you used -fc 403 instead of -fr?` Answer `wp-forum.phps`. Got by observing output difference between `-fc 403` command and command `ffuf -u http://MACHINE_IP/FUZZ -w /opt/wordlist/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-files-lowercase.txt  -fr '/\..*'`
## Fuzzing parameters

- Terminate if any machine running and click on `Start Machine`. Also read this section.
- Question `What is the parameter you found?` Answer `id`. Got it from output of `ffuf -u 'http://MACHINE_IP/sqli-labs/Less-1/?FUZZ=1' -c -w /opt/wordlist/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt -fw 39`.
- Question `What is the highest valid id?` Answer `14`. Got it by running, `for i in {0..255}; do echo $i; done | ffuf -u 'http://MACHINE_IP/sqli-labs/Less-1/?id=FUZZ' -c -w - -fw 33`.
- Question `What is Dummy's password?` Answer `p@ssword`. Got it with command `ffuf -u http://MACHINE_IP/sqli-labs/Less-11/ -c -w /opt/wordlist/SecLists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/hak5.txt -X POST -d 'uname=Dummy&passwd=FUZZ&submit=Submit' -fs 1435 -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' `.
