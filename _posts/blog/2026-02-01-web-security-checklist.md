# Web Security Checklist  
## A Systematic Method to Find Real Bugs — Not Random Guessing

Most bug hunters don’t fail because they lack skill.  
They fail because they **miss things**.

This checklist exists to make sure that **does not happen**.

It’s built from real reports, real triage feedback, and real mistakes that cost money.

## Why Most Bug Hunters Miss Valid Bugs

Common problems:
- Testing without structure
- Forgetting entire classes of issues
- Repeating the same checks on every target
- Relying on memory instead of process

Bug bounty is not about luck.  
It’s about **coverage and consistency**.

## What This Checklist Covers

### Recon & Attack Surface Mapping
- Endpoint discovery without noise
- Parameter identification techniques
- Understanding app logic before testing

### Authentication & Authorization
- IDOR patterns that actually get accepted
- Role confusion and privilege bypass
- Session handling mistakes companies still make

### Input Handling & Injection
- SQLi, NoSQLi, SSTI (realistic testing paths)
- XSS beyond basic payloads
- File upload abuse that bypasses filters

### Business Logic Flaws
- State manipulation issues
- Workflow bypasses
- Price, quantity, and limit abuse

### API & Modern Web Issues
- Broken object level authorization
- Mass assignment
- Improper rate limiting

### Commonly Missed High-Impact Bugs
- Chained vulnerabilities
- Misconfigured features, not just inputs
- Bugs that survive WAFs and scanners

## Why This Checklist Works

This is **not a list of vulnerability names**.

Each item tells you:
- **What to test**
- **Why it matters**
- **What success looks like**

It forces you to think like a reviewer, not just an attacker.

---

## Who This Is For

This checklist is ideal if you:
- Actively hunt on platforms
- Want more **valid** reports, not duplicates
- Feel your testing lacks structure
- Want to scale without burnout

If you already know the basics, this multiplies your results.

---

## How Bug Hunters Use This

- Run it at the **start of every program**
- Use it as a **second-pass safety net**
- Review before submitting reports
- Prevent missed critical issues

Many users say it **paid for itself with a single bug**.
